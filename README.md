Hi, I'm Lakshya Kumar, a passionate self-taught Full Stack web developer from India. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I am also an open-source enthusiast. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
